    <h1>I Love You Mom &lt;3 App</h1>
    <p>
      My mom is very sentimental person, so she would always save one text of my
      brother, sister, and I saying "I Love You" to her. Growing up before
      smartphones, phones were extremely limited on data, so she would
      constantly have to delete text messages to free up space for new incoming
      ones. Sometimes she would accidentally delete our "I Love You" texts and
      would immediately request that we send her a new one. This app is
      primarily designed for my mother so she can save the voice recordings of
      my siblings and I saying "I Love You" to her so she'll always have an easy
      place to access it on her phone. A great Mother's Day surprise as well as
      a useful tool for all people who want to saved recordings of their loved
      ones.
